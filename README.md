The files here are from my 2023 iteration of the project doing basic research to see if folklore is classifiable.
Now I am leading a team on the project to combine natural features with their corresponding motifs in stories to open a glorious bag of WHY/WHY NOT from our results.
(I'm also curious to see if we can apply the program to social media - do we use the same motifs online that we see in our folklore?)

*To run the project, open the train/test file, hit run, & entertain with animal facts while you wait.*


Why this project?
Stories describe the world around us: the monomyth of the coyote teaches rose hip toxicity across the American Plains, 
the Golem is used in modern Jewish lore to approach the epigenetics of trauma, 
and the festival of Tanabata marks the end of the monsoon season through the annual crossing of Vega and Altair in the sky. 
This method of information-sharing is not entirely compatible with the scientific method.
While some tales explain how to stun a bear through pulling on its uvula, others declare that bears live in cottages and drink tea. 
I wanted to use my anthropology, literature, and naturalist backgrounds to explore folklore data to try to close this gap.
 

Some of my coworkers at Glacier National Park were world-leading bear, wolf, lynx, beaver, and mushroom experts. 
Each has studied how folklore has spread knowledge of their species. 
Itâ€™s my goal to make this field of study more credible and accessible using CL statistical methods of research. 




*My write-up from 2023 is in the repository if you are curious for more results,but folktales were classifiable with high (85% and above) accuracy, while mammal features had a very low (10% ~ 20% accuracy)* 

*Now the project is in annotation development stages. We are collecting better datasets, writing guidelines, and reading LOTS Of folklore.

*This 2023 iteration was before I had begun my data structures class. Please keep in mind that I come from a literature, language, & analytics background and am developing better programming skills.
