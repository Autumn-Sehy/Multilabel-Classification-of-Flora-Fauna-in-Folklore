***The files here are from my 2023 iteration of this project, which I've developed extensively since***
***PLEASE see the updated folklore capstone page for better code - this code reflects my coding ability from when I created it, which has greatly improved***

Why this project?
Stories describe the world around us: the monomyth of the coyote teaches rose hip toxicity across the American Plains, 
the Golem is used in modern Jewish lore to approach the epigenetics of trauma, 
and the festival of Tanabata marks the end of the monsoon season through the annual crossing of Vega and Altair in the sky. 
This method of information-sharing can be extractable en-masse using modern NLP tools.
I wanted to use my anthropology, literature, and naturalist backgrounds to explore folklore data to research this information.
 
*My write-up from 2023 is in the repository if you are curious for results, but folktales using basic bigram features and bag-of-words were classifiable with high (85% and above) accuracy, while mammal features had a very low (10% ~ 20% accuracy)*
